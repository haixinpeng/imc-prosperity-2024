# imc-prosperity-2024
IMC Prosperity is an algorithmic trading competition hosted by IMC Trading. The competition has two parts: algorithmic trading and manual trading. In the algorithmic trading section, new products are introduced each round and we have to come up with different trading strategies to improve our pnl. In the manual trading section, simple probability and game theory questions are given. For more information, you can refer to the [official wiki](https://imc-prosperity.notion.site/Prosperity-2-Wiki-fe650c0292ae4cdb94714a3f5aa74c85).
